ITU ROV Team is a team of undergraduate students that are developing a Remotely Operated Vehicle(ROV) to attend the MATE ROV Competition in California in 2017.

All the software and hardware will be open source.

This is the Ground Control Station repository and in this repository, the c# codes written for controlling all the functionality of the ROV over a Windows PC will be shared.
